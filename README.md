# Rick and Morty Characters

It is just a quick [app](https://wilberc.github.io/rick-and-morty-characters/ "app") made with Vanilla JS and [Boostrap Custom Styles](https://bootswatch.com/ "Boostrap Custom Styles") that shows you all the characters, and some extra information, from the original serie. All the data was provided by [Rick and Morty API ](https://rickandmortyapi.com/ "Rick and Morty API ").

It also could be a good quick demo on how to use Arrow Functions, Fetch APIs and DOM manipulation. Feel free to use the code (MIT License).
